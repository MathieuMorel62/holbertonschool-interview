# Linked List Palindrome

![Project Image](file-z6vFtrH8S2oGHp8f1eVQ278A)

## Description
The "Linked List Palindrome" project is designed to develop a C application that checks if a linked list is a palindrome. A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. The project involves creating a linked list data structure, functions for adding and freeing nodes, and the main function to determine if the list is a palindrome. This project is crucial for understanding complex data structures and algorithms in computer science.

## Resources
- [Linked List Documentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list)
- [C Programming Guide](https://www.learn-c.org/)
- [GitHub - Betty Style](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty)

## Technologies and Tools Used
- `C Language`: Used for application development due to its performance and closeness to hardware.
- `GitHub`: Versioning platform for code tracking and collaboration.
- `Betty Style`: A coding style for C, ensuring code readability and maintainability.

## Prerequisites
- `GCC version 4.8.4`: Compiler for the C language.
- `Ubuntu 14.04 LTS`: Recommended operating system for compiling and running the project.

## Installation and Configuration
1. Clone the GitHub repository: 

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview.git
```

2. Move to the appropriate directory:

```sh
cd linked_list_palindrome
```

3. Compile the project with GCC: gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o palindrome

```sh
cd gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o palindrome
```

4. Run the executable:

```sh
./palindrome
```

## Usage
- Run the program with a predefined linked list to check if it is a palindrome.
- Modify values in the list to test different scenarios.

## Main Features
1. **Linked List Creation**: Builds the necessary data structure.
2. **Palindrome Verification**: Central algorithm to determine if the list is a palindrome.

## Task List
0. [**Linked List Palindrome**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/linked_list_palindrome): Develop a function to check if a linked list is a palindrome.

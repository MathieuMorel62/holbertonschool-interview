## Description
This repository is dedicated to technical interview preparation with a focus on algorithms. Each week, a new algorithm challenge is provided. These exercises are designed to help individuals enhance their problem-solving skills, progressively increasing in complexity over time. By following this repository, users can build and refine their algorithmic skills while systematically preparing for technical interviews.

## Algorithm

Here is a series of algorithms to solve, each designed to enhance problem-solving skills as we progress:

1. [**Lockboxes**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/lockboxes): Check if all locked boxes can be opened with provided keys. Return True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise, return False.

2. [**Insert In Sorted Linked List**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/insert_in_sorted_linked_list): Implements a function in C for inserting a number into a simply linked list while maintaining its order. This algorithm focuses on understanding and manipulating complex data structures, specifically linked lists.

3. [**Heap Insert**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/heap_insert): This algorithm implements an insertion method in a Max Binary Heap, essential for optimizing data operations like insertion and retrieval. It's key for understanding heap operations and tree-based data structures in programming.

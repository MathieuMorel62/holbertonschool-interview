## Description
This repository is dedicated to technical interview preparation with a focus on algorithms. Each week, a new algorithm challenge is provided. These exercises are designed to help individuals enhance their problem-solving skills, progressively increasing in complexity over time. By following this repository, users can build and refine their algorithmic skills while systematically preparing for technical interviews.

## Algorithm

Here is a series of algorithms to solve, each designed to enhance problem-solving skills as we progress:

1. [**Lockboxes**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/lockboxes): Check if all locked boxes can be opened with provided keys. Return True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise, return False.

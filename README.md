## Description
This repository is dedicated to technical interview preparation with a focus on algorithms. Each week, a new algorithm challenge is provided. These exercises are designed to help individuals enhance their problem-solving skills, progressively increasing in complexity over time. By following this repository, users can build and refine their algorithmic skills while systematically preparing for technical interviews.

## Algorithm

Here is a series of algorithms to solve, each designed to enhance problem-solving skills as we progress:

1. [**Lockboxes**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/lockboxes): Check if all locked boxes can be opened with provided keys. Return True if all boxes can be opened, otherwise, return False.

2. [**Insert In Sorted Linked List**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/insert_in_sorted_linked_list): Implements a function in C for inserting a number into a simply linked list while maintaining its order. This algorithm focuses on understanding and manipulating complex data structures, specifically linked lists.

3. [**Heap Insert**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/heap_insert): This algorithm implements an insertion method in a Max Binary Heap, essential for optimizing data operations like insertion and retrieval. It's key for understanding heap operations and tree-based data structures in programming.

4. [**Minimum Operation**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/minimum_operations): This challenge involves finding the minimum number of operations needed to reach a certain number of 'H' characters in a text file, starting with a single 'H'. The only operations allowed are "Copy All" and "Paste", testing one's ability to devise a strategy for efficient operation sequencing and resource utilization.

5. [**Sandpiles**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/sandpiles): This project involves a function for summing two sandpiles, focusing on stability conditions. It's a practical exercise in algorithm optimization and memory management.

6. [**Linked List Palindrome**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/linked_list_palindrome): This challenge involves creating a C function to determine if a singly linked list is a palindrome, testing skills in data structures and algorithm efficiency.

7. [**Log Parsing**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/log_parsing): This project involves the creation of a Python script to read and analyze logs in real time from stdin. The script extracts metrics such as the total file size and the account of HTTP status codes in the logs, while managing non-compliant formats and user interruptions. This challenge tests the skills in regular expressions, data flow processing and signal management.

8. [**Linked List Cycle**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/linked_list_cycle): This challenge consists of developing a C function capable of detecting a cycle in a simple chained list. This task is essential to avoid endless loops in data structures, thus optimizing memory management and algorithm performance. This project focuses on the in-depth understanding of chained lists and techniques to identify potentially complex problems in data structures.

9. [**Palindrome Integer**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/palindrome_integer): This project involves writing a function in C to determine whether a given unsigned integer is a palindrome. This task is essential to understand the basic concepts of C programming, including number manipulation and the implementation of logical algorithms.

10. [**UTF8 Validation**](https://github.com/MathieuMorel62/holbertonschool-interview/tree/main/utf8_validation): This project involves creating a `validUTF8(data)` method to check if a data set is a valid UTF-8 encoding. Each UTF-8 character can be 1 to 4 bytes long. The data, represented by a list of integers (each integer representing 1 byte), only processes the least significant 8 bits of each integer.
